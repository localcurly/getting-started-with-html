 <H2> Basics of the web
 </H2></body>
 

 
 <p> -The world wide web is made up of hyper text 
 markup language documents, or <b> html </b> documents for short
   <br><br> -The web was invented in the 1990s and has an estimated
   30 million pages. <br> <br> -In order to function it has 3 major peices.
   (Your computer browser, the internet, and servers)

  <h2> HTML & Markup</h2>
  
  <p> HTML is made up of: <br> -Text Content <br>
  - Markup <br>  -References to other documents <br> -Links <br> <br> Text
  content is rather
  self-explanitory, as for markup? -Not so much. Markup
  is made up of tags that tell one's
  computer what to do. <br> <br> For example, < b > makes text 
  <b> bolded.</b> <br> & < em > makes things <em> italicized. </em></em>
  

  </p>.
  
  
  
  <h2> Computers are Stupid</h2>
  
  <p> Computers take the information they are given <b> very</b>
  literally. This makes them 
  very sensitive to things like typos and other human errors.</p>
  
  <h2> Inline vs Block</h2>
  <p> HTML elements can be either inline or block, meaning they are either
  aligned with the text or, an "invisible
  box" is places around it.</p>
